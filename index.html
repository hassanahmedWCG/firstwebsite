                Generative Artificial Intelligence can generate specific types of media depending upon its training dataset. <br>Here we can see an image of a middle-aged man that has been generated by AI. Such technologies push the boundaries of what was thought possible, and raise significant ethical and security concerns at the same time.

        Artificial General Intelligence, or AGI, is an Artificial Intelligence with capabilities on par with or better than a human's.<br> It has not yet been achieved, but it is not that far off based on current predictions and acceleration of AI research.<br> Pictured is Sophia the Robot, who is an example of how AGI might behave (Sophia does not have AGI, she can only behave similarly to one).
